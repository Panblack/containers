https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_8/index#kickstart-changes_installation-and-booting
5.8. Image creation
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/composing_a_customized_rhel_system_image/index
- `yum install osbuild-composer`
- `composer-cli`

8.3.2. The imjournal option and configuring system logging with minimized journald usage
8.3.3. Negative effects of the default logging setup on performance
The default logging environment setup might consume 4 GB of memory or even more and adjustments of rate-limit values are complex when systemd-journald is running with rsyslog.
8.7.1. shadow-utils no longer allow all-numeric user and group names
The useradd and groupadd commands disallow user and group names consisting purely of numeric characters.
8.7.2. securetty is now disabled by default
